              Our idea is to incentivize people to reduce their carbon footprint by tracking monthly
              usage of electricity, water, and gas and comparing personal usage statistics against
              local and global trends. The residential sector accounts for 21% of energy usage in
              the US, and even a small reduction in energy usage across households would have a
              significant impact on carbon emissions. We chose electricity, water, and gas because
              they are easy to track, commonly billed utilities, and individuals have control over
              their personal usage.
